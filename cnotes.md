# Collection of notes in the C language

Scratch:     Say(hello, world)

```C
printf("hello, world\n");
```

All printed words are called strings and strings are enclosed "string" <br>
\n tells computer to start a new line <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of a sentence. It tells the computer that this is the end of the statement.

Scratch:  Set counter to 0

```C
int counter = 0;
```

In C you must declare the type of variables you are creating

Scratch:   Change counter by 1

```C
counter = counter + 1; # add any number to counter;
counter += 1 # add any number to counter;
counter++ # only adds plus 1 to counter;
```

The = sign is not "equals", it means "assign" or "get".

Once you have created a variable, you do not need to keep telling the computer what type of variable it will be such as "int".

```C
if (x<y) them
{
    printf("x is less than y\n);
}
```

Scratch : If x<y then
say x is less then y
else
say x is not less then y

```C
    if (x < y)
{
    printf ("x is less then y\n);
}
else
{
    print ("x is not less then y\n);
}
```
